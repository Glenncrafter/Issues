Hey I'm Glenn,

My IGN is Glenncrafter and I'm vip

I send this to say that I'm stuck in the ground and can't move anymore.
It happened when I did the quest:"Wynnzxcavation site B", when I got some purple cyrstals I teleported but I teleported in the ground next to the normal place I had to be teleportated.
My co√∂rdinates are X: 56,3  Y: 68  Z: -530,3
I hope you guys can help me because I really want to play all quests etc..

Thx for reading.
